/**
 * Cross-validation is a technique for assessing how the results of a
 * statistical analysis will generalize to an independent data set.
 * It is mainly used in settings where the goal is prediction, and one
 * wants to estimate how accurately a predictive model will perform in
 * practice. One round of cross-validation involves partitioning a sample
 * of data into complementary subsets, performing the analysis on one subset
 * (called the training set), and validating the analysis on the other subset
 * (called the validation set or testing set). To reduce variability, multiple
 * rounds of cross-validation are performed using different partitions, and the
 * validation results are averaged over the rounds.
